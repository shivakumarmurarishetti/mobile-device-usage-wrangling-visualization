## 📊 Visual Analysis

The following visualizations were created as part of the exploratory analysis:

- Distribution of daily app usage time  
- App usage comparison by gender  
- Scatter plot of age vs app usage  
- Summary statistics of numerical features  
- Combined overview of all generated graphs  

All figures are available below:

## 📈 Key Insights

- App usage time varies significantly across users
- Gender-based differences in usage patterns are observable
- Age shows a weak relationship with daily app usage time
- Numerical features provide useful context for understanding engagement levels

Detailed explanations and interpretations are documented in the project report.
